# cat-facia-lpain
tensorflow's version is 2.9.1
keras' version is 2.9.0
The project is divided into two parts, the first part has three code files, namely 'customfinal.py', 'resnet50.py' and 'Vgg16.py' all three. These models are trained using overall evaluation.
The second part is trained on each of the seven features of the cat's face, followed by a decision tree model and a Bayesian model for final pain level recognition.
The file mainly consists of a convolutional neural network model with seven different features and a dataset with seven different features with the processing file. A 'main.py' file is included, which introduces the decision tree model and the Bayesian model.
The ultimate aim of the project is to classify the level of facial pain in cats by two means: overall recognition classification and feature recognition classification.
